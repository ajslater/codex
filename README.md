## <a name="installation">üì¶ Installation</a>

### Install & Run with Docker

Run the official [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ajslater/codex). Instructions for running the docker image are on the Docker Hub README. This is the recommended way to run Codex.

You'll then want to read the [Administration](#administration) section of this document.

### Install & Run as a Native Application

You can also run Codex as a natively installed python application with pip.

#### Wheel Build Dependencies

You'll need to install these system dependencies before installing Codex.

##### macOS

```sh
brew install jpeg libffi libyaml libzip openssl python unrar xapian
```

##### Linux

###### Debian based (e.g. Ubuntu)

```sh
apt install build-essential libffi-dev libjpeg-dev libssl-dev libxapian30 libyaml-dev python3-pip python3-xapian zlib1g-dev
```

###### Alpine

```sh
apk add bsd-compat-headers build-base jpeg-dev libffi-dev openssl-dev xapian-bindings-python3 xapian-core yaml-dev zlib-dev
```

##### Install unrar Runtime Dependency on Linux

Codex requires unrar to read cbr formatted comic archives. Unrar is often not packaged for Linux, but here are some instructions: [How to install unrar in Linux](https://www.unixtutorial.org/how-to-install-unrar-in-linux/)

Unrar as packaged for Alpine Linux v3.14 seems to work on Alpine v3.15

#### Windows

Codex should work on Windows, but I do not understand the binary requirements. I suggest using the
other operating system package lists as a guide. If you get it working, please
[help me](https://github.com/ajslater/codex/issues) replace this section with something useful.

In the mean time, Windows users will have the easiest experience relying on Docker.

#### Install Codex with pip

You may now install Codex with pip

```sh
pip3 install codex
```

#### Run Codex Natively

pip should install the codex binary on your path. Run

```sh
codex
```

and then navigate to <http://localhost:9810/>

## <a name="administration">üëë Administration</a>

### Change the Admin password

The first thing you should do is log in as the admin user and change the admin password.

#### Navigate to the Admin Panel

- Click the hamburger menu ‚ò∞ to open the browser settings drawer.
- Log in as the 'admin' user. The default administator password is also 'admin'.
- Navigate to the Admin Panel by clicking on its link in the browser settings drawer after you have logged in.

##### In the Admin Panel, Change the Password

- Navigate to the AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION Users panel.
- Select the `admin` user.
- Change the admin password using the small "this form" link in the password section.
- You may also change the admin user's name or anything else.
- You may grant other users admin privileges by making them staff.

### Adding Comic Libraries

The second thing you will want to do is log in as an Administrator and add one or more comic libraries.

#### From the Admin Panel, Add Comic Libraries

- Navigate to the CODEX Libraries Panel in the Admin Panel
- Add a Library with the "ADD LIBRARY +" button in the upper right.

### Reset the admin password

If you forget all your superuser passwords, you may restore the original default admin account by running codex with the `CODEX_RESET_ADMIN` environment variable set.

```sh
CODEX_RESET_ADMIN=1 codex
```

or, if using Docker:

```sh
docker run -e CODEX_RESET_ADMIN=1 -v <host path to config>/config:/config ajslater/codex
```

### Private Libraries

In the Admin Panel you may configure private libraries that are only accessible to specific groups.

A library with _no_ groups is accessible to every user including anonymous users.

A library with _any_ groups is accessible only to users who are in those groups.

Use the Groups admin panel to create groups and the Users admin panel to add and remove users to groups.

## <a name="configuration">‚öôÔ∏è Configuration</a>

### Config Dir

The default config directory is `config/` directly under the working directory you run codex from. You may specify an alternate config directory with the environment variable `CODEX_CONFIG_DIR`.

The config directory contains a file named `hypercorn.toml` where you can specify ports and bind addresses. If no `hypercorn.toml` is present Codex copies a default one to that directory on startup.

The default values for the config options are:

```toml
bind = ["0.0.0.0:9810"]
quick_bind = ["0.0.0.0:9810"]
root_path = "/codex"
max_db_ops = 100000

```

The config directory also holds the main sqlite database, the Xapian search index, a Django cache and comic book cover thumbnails.

### Environment Variables

- `LOGLEVEL` will change how verbose codex's logging is. Valid values are `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, `VERBOSE`, `DEBUG`. The default is `INFO`.
- `TIMEZONE` or `TZ` will explicitly the timezone in long format (e.g. `"America/Los Angeles"`). This is useful inside Docker because codex cannot automatically detect the host machine's timezone.
- `CODEX_CONFIG_DIR` will set the path to codex config directory. Defaults to `$CWD/config`
- `CODEX_RESET_ADMIN=1` will reset the admin user and its password to defaults when codex starts.
- `CODEX_SKIP_INTEGRITY_CHECK` will skip the database integrity repair that runs when codex starts.

### Reverse Proxy

[nginx](https://nginx.org/) is often used as a TLS terminator and subpath proxy.

Here's an example nginx config with a subpath named '/codex'.

```nginx
    # HTTP
    proxy_set_header  Host              $http_host;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Host  $server_name;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Port  $server_port;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header  X-Scheme          $scheme;

    # Websockets
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade"

    # This example uses a docker container named 'codex' at sub-path /codex
    # Use a valid IP or resolvable host name for other configurations.
    location /codex {
        proxy_pass  http://codex:9810;
    }
```

Specify a reverse proxy sub path (if you have one) in `config/hypercorn.toml`

```toml
root_path = "/codex"

```

#### Nginx Reverse Proxy 502 when container refreshes

Nginx requires a special trick to refresh dns when linked Docker containers
recreate. See this [nginx with dynamix upstreams](https://tenzer.dk/nginx-with-dynamic-upstreams/) article.

## <a name="usage">üìñ Usage</a>

### Sessions & Accounts

Once your administrator has added some comic libraries, you may browse and read comics. Codex will remember your preferences, bookmarks and progress in the browser session. Codex destroys anonymous sessions and bookmarks after 60 days.
To preserve these settings across browsers and after sessions expire, you may register an account with a username and password.
You will have to contact your administrator to reset your password if you forget it.

### üîé Search Help

[Codex's metadata search engine has it's own help page.

## <a name="troubleshooting">ü©∫ Troubleshooting</a>

### Logs

Codex collects its logs in the `config/logs` directory. Take a look to see what th e server is doing.

You can change how much codex logs by setting the `LOGLEVEL` environment variable. By default this level is `INFO`. To see more messages run codex like:

```bash
LOGLEVEL=VERBOSE codex
```

To see a great deal of noisy messages from dependencies try:

```bash
LOGLEVEL=DEBUG codex
```

### Watching Filesystem Events with Docker

Codex tries to watch for filesystem events to instantly update your comic libraries when they change on disk. But these native filesystem events are not translated between macOS & Windows Docker hosts and the Docker Linux container. If you find that your installation is not updating to filesystem changes instantly, you might try enabling polling for the affected libraries and decreasing the `poll_every` value in the Admin console to a frequency that suits you.

### Emergency Database Repair

If the database becomes corrupt, Codex includes a facitlity to rebuild the database.
Place a file named `rebuild_db` in your Codex config directory like so:

```sh
  touch config/rebuild_db
```

Shut down and restart Codex.

The next time Codex starts it will back up the existing database and try to rebuild it.
The database lives in the config directory as the file `config/db.sqlite3`.
If this procedure goes kablooey, you may recover the original database at `config/db.sqlite3.backup`.

### Bulk Database Updates Fail

I've tested Codex's bulk database updater to batch 100,000 filesystem events at a time. With enough RAM Codex could probably batch much more. But if you find that updating large batches of comics are failing, consider setting a the `max_db_ops` value in `hypercorn.toml` to a lower value. 1000 will probably still be pretty fast, for instance.

### Bug Reports

Issues are best filed [here on github](https://github.com/ajslater/codex/issues).
I and other Codex users often lurk on the [Mylar support channels](https://github.com/mylar3/mylar3#live-support--conversation). It would be polite to use the `#anything-other-than-mylar` Discord channel to ask for help with Codex.

## <a name="out-of-scope">üö´ Out of Scope</a>

- I have no intention of making this an eBook reader.
- I think metadata editing would be better placed in a comic manager than a reader.

## <a name="alternatives-to-codex">üìöAlternatives</a>

- [Komga](https://komga.org/) has light metadata editing.
- [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/) has light metadata filtering/editing and supports comics and eBooks.
- [Ubooquity](https://vaemendis.net/ubooquity/) reads both comics and eBooks.
- [Mylar](https://github.com/mylar3/mylar3) is the best comic book manager which also has a built in reader.
- [Comictagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger) seems to be the best comic metadata editor. It comes with a powerful command line and useful desktop GUI.

## <a name="develop-codex">üõ† Develop</a>

Codex is a Django Python webserver with a VueJS front end.

`/codex/codex/` is the main django app which provides the webserver and database.

`/codex/frontend/` is where the vuejs frontend lives.

`/codex/dev-env-setup.sh` will install development dependencies.

`/codex/dev-ttabs.sh` will run the three or four different servers recommended for development in terminal tabs.

`/codex/dev-codex.sh` runs the main Django server. Set the `DEBUG` environment variable to activate debug mode: `DEBUG=1 ./run.sh`. This also lets you run the server without collecting static files for production and with a hot reloading frontend. I recommend setting `LOGLEVEL=VERBOSE` for development as well.
