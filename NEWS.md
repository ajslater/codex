## v1.8.11

- Fixes
    - Restarting Codex with Codex would still crash. More comprehensive fix.

## v1.8.10

- Fixes

      broke.
        - Sorry non-docker homies! Thanks @professionaltart.
    - Fix universes not being search indexed (very rare).
    - More reliable re-render for browser page slider and navigation buttons.

## v1.8.9

      metadata.

      can be applied.

      folder.

## v1.8.8

- Fixes
    - Fix import crash on some Metron tagged comics with a primary identifier
      source.

## v1.8.7

- Fixes
    - Make Full Text Search table smaller. Some irrelevant fields and data were
      causing exponential bloat, crippling large libraries.
    - Fix search by field for string fields, identifiers and issue.
    - Fix overflow on browser card titles.

## v1.8.6

- Fixes
    - Scale search index sync batch size with memory. Large search sync query
      was preventing search sync of large databases on small machines.

## v1.8.5

- Fixes
    - Better fix for persistent settings. Old fix could lead to settings that
      never clear.

## v1.8.4

- Fixes
    - Fix not importing page_count when import metadata is off, leads to
      unreadable books.
    - Fix persistent settings.

    - Fix searching by string like fields in the search bar like 'path'.
    - Fix minor search update exception when there's nothing search related to
      update on import.

## v1.8.2

## v1.8.1

    - Fix minor search update exception.

## v1.8.0

- Features
    - Support
      [MetronInfo.xml v1.0 Schema](https://metron-project.github.io/docs/category/metroninfo)
      for comic metadata.
    - Support CB7 (7zip) comic archives.
    - Search Indexing now also done in the import phase which is faster than
      syncing from the db:
        - 20k comics both imported and indexed in 9 minutes on my old macbook at
          a rate of 30 comics per second. Half a million comics might take less
          than 5 hours on the same machine.
        - However this update replaces the search index and Codex will sync the
          search index when it starts.
    - Fewer database updates when comics change metadata or don't change
      metadata at all means fewer and faster update imports.
    - New Tags:
        - Add Universes. Main Characters, and Main Team marked with a â˜….
        - Metron tags can provide links to web databases for each tag.
    - New Import Metadata on Demand Admin Flag.
    - Add manual Import Abort task for admins.
    - Browser tab titles show route and page title, no longer show custom
      banner.
    - Logging format changed.

      Group.
    - Fixed filtering on Critical Rating and FileType
    - Fixed searching on Critical Rating field.
    - Bug displaying Age Rating, Original Format, Scan Info, Tagger in metadata.
