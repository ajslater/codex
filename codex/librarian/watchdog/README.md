# Watchdog

- Extends the Watchdog API with custom Observers, DirSnapshot, Emitter.
- The Observers determine whether or not to watch different paths by
  querying the Library objects.
- A CodexDatabaseSnapshot exists to compare the codex database
  against a standard DirSnapshot
- Events are batched into large tasks for the Updater by the
  EventBatcher. The Emitter could do this more efficiently, but I'm
  also using the standard FileSystemObserver that spits them into a queue.
