<h1>Failed Imports</h1>
<p>
Comic archives that have failed to import.
This list is updated every time the library updates. 
You should probably review these files and fix or remove them
</p>
<h2>Fixing comics</h2>
<p>
Try using the zip fixer:
<pre>
cp problem-comic.cbz /somewhere/safe/problem-comic.cbz.backup
zip -F problem-comic.cbz --out fixed.zip
mv fixed.zip problem-comic.cbz
</pre>
to fix comics. I've found that even if the fixed comic looks exactly the same as the original, replacing the original with the fixed archive can often get Codex to import it properly.<br/>
If you've removed or fixed the unimportable comics in your library you can try polling the library again.<br/>
You may also try <code>zip -FF</code> to fix comics which uses a different (not necissarily better) algorithm to fix archives.
</p>
<h2>Reporting Issues</h2>
</p>
If the comic looks good to you, but still shows up as a failed import, it might be Codex's fault for not importing it correctly. Please file an <a href="https://github.com/ajslater/codex/issues">Issue Report</a> and include the stack trace from the logs at <code>config/logs/codex.log</code> if you can.
