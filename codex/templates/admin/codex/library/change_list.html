<h1>Libraries</h1>
<p>
A Library is a path where Codex can recursively search for comic archives. Codex will try to import comics from a Library immediately.
You may navigate back to the browser view by clicking the "<span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps">view site</span>" link in the upper right of this Admin Panel.
</p><p>
Wait for comics to appear. It may take some time to import large comic libraries and Codex will refresh the browser the library has finished loaded. A snackbar will notify admins that a library update is in progress, but check the logs in <code>config/logs/codex.log</code> if you want to follow the import in detail.
</p>
<h2>events</h2>
Watch the Library filesystem for events and update Codex instantly when the filesystem changes.
<h2>poll</h2>
Periodically poll the library for changes. Possibly CPU and disk intensive.
<h2>poll every</h2>
How long to wait between polling the filesystem
<h2>last poll</h2>
A timestamp telling you when the last time this library was polled.
