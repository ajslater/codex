        <h1>Libraries</h1>
        <div>
            A Library is a path where Codex can recursively search for comic archives.
            Codex will try to import comics from a Library immediately. You may navigate
            back to the browser view by clicking the "<span class="caps">view site</span
            >" link in the upper right of this Admin Panel.
        </div>
        <div>
            Wait for comics to appear. It may take some time to import large comic
            libraries and Codex will refresh the browser the library has finished
            loaded. A snackbar will notify admins that a library update is in progress,
            but check the logs in <code>config/logs/codex.log</code> if you want to
            follow the import in detail.
        </div>
        <h2>events</h2>
        Watch the Library filesystem for events and update Codex instantly when the
        filesystem changes.
        <h2>poll</h2>
        Periodically poll the library for changes. Possibly CPU and disk intensive.
        <h2>poll every</h2>
        How long to wait between polling the filesystem
        <h2>last poll</h2>
        A timestamp telling you when the last time this library was polled.
        <h2>groups</h2>
        A library with <em>no</em> groups is accessible to every user and non-users if
        those are enabled.
        <br />
        A library with <em>any</em> groups is accessible only to users who are in
        those groups. Use the Groups admin panel to create groups and the Users admin
        panel to add users to groups.
        <br />
        <br />
        <small>Hold down “control”, or “command” on a Mac, to select more than one.</small>
        <h1>Actions</h1>
        <h2>Delete selected libraries</h2>
        Will delete the selected libraries from the codex database. Will not delete
        your comic archives on disk. Deleting large libraries may take a long time to
        create the confirmation screen.
        <h2>Poll Selected libraries for changes</h2>
        Poll selected libraries now for changes. Update the library if changes are
        detected.
        <h2>Update All Comics in Selected Libraries</h2>
        Forcibly update all the comics for a library, overwrite the database and
        regenerate covers.
        <h2>Recreate Comic Covers in Selected Libraries</h2>
        Recreate all the comic covers for a library.
