<h1>Libraries</h1>
<p>
A Library is a path where Codex can recursively search for comic archives. Codex will try to import comics from a Library immediately.
You may navigate back to the browser view by clicking the "<span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps">view site</span>" link in the upper right of this Admin Panel.
</p><p>
Wait for comics to appear. It may take some time to import large comic libraries and Codex will refresh the browser the library has finished loaded. A snackbar will notify admins that a scan is in progress, but check the logs in <code>config/logs/codex.log</code> if you want to follow the import in detail.
</p>
