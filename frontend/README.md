# Codex Frontend

The codex frontend is built with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com).

## Development

See the package.json file for common development scripts. Running the live reloading dev server is your best bet.

## Production

After being built, the javascript & css assets are collected by the django collectstatic script and packaged with the main server app.
